# 👋 Hey, I'm Kevin Buxton

I’m a Software Engineering student at Zetech University, passionate about using technology to build ideas that make life more structured and creative.

💡 I enjoy experimenting with:
- Web & App Development (HTML, CSS, Python)
- Automation projects (like WhatsApp bots)
- Exploring how small ideas can evolve into impactful digital tools

🧠 Current focus:
Sharpening my coding logic, understanding real-world systems, and learning how to turn raw ideas into working tech.

🎯 Goal:
To create meaningful tech solutions that mix creativity, structure, and purpose.
